#  - First line is the test name.
#  - Comment lines begin with '#' but cannot have comment on first line.
#  - Second non-comment line sets the 'fail_period' (how often failures occur)
#    and verbosity level. (Here fail_period = 0 means no failures.)
#  - Subsequent lines define the clients that will be started concurrently
#    - Each client in the test file is specified as:
#      "ops_file_name" "count" "timeout"
#        - "ops_file_name" is the file containing the list of client ops
#        - "count" is number of times a new client process will run this set of
#          ops (sequentially, i.e., each starts after previous one finishes)
#        - "timeout" is time limit (in seconds) for client to complete its ops
